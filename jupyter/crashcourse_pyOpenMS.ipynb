However, they are not python lists but cython vectors, which means looping is a bit more elaborate. (*Also, you can not persitantly write into objects you retrieve that way, only `push_back` new items or swap the whole vector*). The spectra will be mixed MS1 and MS2 spectra. You can keep them apart by inspecting their MSLevel attribute by calling `getMSLevel`. There is more information to be had, e.g. with `getNativeID`. Important is that almost all strings you retrieve from cython objects will be binary encoded, which means you have to decode them first."
